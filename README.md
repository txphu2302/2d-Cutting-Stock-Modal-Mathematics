# 2D Cutting Tool

This is a 2D cutting tool that helps optimize the process of cutting large rectangular materials into smaller parts with minimal waste area or cutting cost. The tool applies optimization algorithms like linear programming and cutting algorithms to solve cutting problems in manufacturing industries.

## Description

The 2D cutting tool supports cutting 2D materials, mainly rectangles, into smaller parts based on specified sizes. It helps minimize waste area or optimize cutting cost. Features include:
- Cutting a large rectangle into smaller parts with specified dimensions.
- Minimizing waste area or optimizing cutting cost.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Dependencies: `matplotlib`, `flask`
- Operating system: Windows.

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/txphu2302/2d-Cutting-Stock-Modal-Mathematics
